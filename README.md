# tcp_smtp_simulation.pkt
Simulation of TCP and SMTP protocol communication using Cisco Packet Tracer.
## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates the simulation of **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It shows how reliable data transfer and email communication are achieved through packet exchange, error handling, and client-server interaction.

## 📝 Features  
- TCP 3-way handshake and reliable packet delivery.  
- SMTP email communication between client and mail server.  
- Packet-level visualization using Cisco Packet Tracer.  

## ⚙️ Skills Applied  
- Networking concepts (TCP/IP model, OSI layers).  
- Client-server architecture.  
- Protocol-level understanding of TCP & SMTP.  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Cisco Packet Tracer
